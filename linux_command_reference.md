  done
}
```
just prints created/updated on terminal when the command is executed

# 🏗️ Project-Specific Context

I’ve been simulating a **real-world company (Skylines Solutions)** using these commands:
- Created directories: `HR`, `Finance`, `Sales`, `Development`
- Created department-specific files using `touch`
- Moved files between departments using `mv`
- Backed up the company using `tar`
- Customized `.bashrc` with aliases and functions for productivity
- Used WSL Ubuntu terminal integrated with Windows Desktop for workflow efficiency
